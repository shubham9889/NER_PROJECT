# NER_PROJECT
Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model
This project involves training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using SpaCy and deploying it as a REST API using FastAPI. The API takes text as input and returns recognized entities.

Features
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, entity tagging)
Training an NER model using SpaCy
Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
FastAPI-based REST API for entity recognition
JWT authentication for secure API access
Optional Docker containerization
